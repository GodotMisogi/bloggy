I've been studying some physics for a while and decided to write solution manuals for reference in case I forget the approach to a problem later. I've been pretty lazy in writing them, so it's very sloppy and some solutions might be incomplete, incorrect or have illogical statements here and there. Here's what I've compiled so far:

<a href="../Solution Manuals/Lancaster Solutions.pdf" target="_blank">Tom Lancaster et. al. - Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur</a>
<a href="../Solution Manuals/Schutz Solutions.pdf" target="_blank">Bernard F. Schutz - A First Course in General Relativity</a>
<a href="../Solution Manuals/Shankar Solutions.pdf" target="_blank">Ramamurti Shankar - Principles of Quantum Mechanics</a>
