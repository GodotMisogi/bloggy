I've been studying some physics for a while and decided to write solution manuals for reference in case I forget the approach to a problem later. I've been pretty lazy in writing them, so it's very sloppy and some solutions might be incomplete, incorrect or have illogical statements here and there. Here's what I've compiled so far:

I've also been studying a course on *Hopf Algebras and Combinatorics* and writing down notes with `Vyn` from freenode's `##math`:
