      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying some physics for a while and decided to write solution manuals for reference in case I forget the approach to a problem later. I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty lazy in writing them, so it&amp;rsquo;s very sloppy and some solutions might be incomplete, incorrect or have illogical statements here and there. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled so far:
Tom Lancaster et. al. - Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted AmateurBernard F. Schutz - A First Course in General RelativityRamamurti Shankar - Principles of Quantum MechanicsT.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a guitarist for approximately 10 years, so I&amp;rsquo;ve written a song or two over the past decade. I&amp;rsquo;ve also tried engaging in music production (with little luck), and still try to learn more about it everyday and improve my mixing and mastering abilities. I still have a lot more songs to finish, if I can ever get over my writer&amp;rsquo;s block and learn how to mix drums properly. A mix I&amp;rsquo;m particularly proud of is a song called Talk by my friend&amp;rsquo;s band called Paradox, which won multiple college competitions across the country while they were active.</description>

      <description>I never really saw myself ever getting involved in any kind of designing activities, as I don&amp;rsquo;t feel I&amp;rsquo;m artistic enough or have the required a e s t h e t i c abilities. However, that changed when I was given the responsibility to design a couple of posters, presentations and brochures for my team AeroMIT, our university&amp;rsquo;s aeromodelling team. I created a couple of items which I think are alright.</description>
